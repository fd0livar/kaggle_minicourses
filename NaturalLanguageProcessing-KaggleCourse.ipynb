    "Machine learning models don't learn from raw text data. Instead, you need to convert the text to something numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest common representation is a variation of one-hot encoding. You represent each document as a vector of term frequencies for each term in the vocabulary. The vocabulary is built from all the tokens (terms) in the corpus (the collection of documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, take the sentences \"Tea is life. Tea is love.\" and \"Tea is healthy, calming, and delicious.\" as our corpus. The vocabulary then is `{\"tea\", \"is\", \"life\", \"love\", \"healthy\", \"calming\", \"and\", \"delicious\"}` (ignoring punctuation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each document, count up how many times a term occurs, and place that count in the appropriate element of a vector. The first sentence has \"tea\" twice and that is the first position in our vocabulary, so we put the number 2 in the first element of the vector. Our sentences as vectors then look like:\n",
    "$$v_1 = [2 2 1 1 0 0 0 0] \\\\\n",
    "  v_2 = [1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1]$$\n",
    "  \n",
    "This is called the **bag of words** representation. You can see that documents with similar terms will have similar vectors. Vocabularies frequently have tens of thousands of terms, so these vectors can be very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common representation is **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**. TF-IDF is similar to bag of words except that each term count is scaled by the term's frequency in the corpus. Using TF-IDF can potentially improve your models. You won't need it here. Feel free to look it up though!\n",

When you create a spaCy model with `nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')`, there are default pipes that perform part of speech tagging, entity recognition, and other transformations. When you run text through a model `doc = nlp(\"Some text here\")`, the output of the pipes are attached to the tokens in the doc object. The lemmas for `token.lemma_` come from one of these pipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can remove or add pipes to models. What we'll do here is create an empty model without any pipes (other than a tokenizer, since all models always have a tokenizer). Then, we'll create a TextCategorizer pipe and add it to the empty model."

Vector encodings are learned by considering the context in which the words appear. Words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors. For example, vectors for \"leopard\", \"lion\", and \"tiger\" will be close together, while they'll be far away from \"planet\" and \"castle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Even cooler, relations between words can be examined with mathematical operations. Subtracting the vectors for \"man\" and \"woman\" will return another vector. If you add that to the vector for \"king\" the result is close to the vector for \"queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors can be used as features for machine learning models. Word vectors will typically improve the performance of your models above bag of words encoding. `spaCy` provides embeddings learned from a model called Word2Vec. You can access them by loading a large language model like `en_core_web_lg`. Then they will be available on tokens from the `.vector` attribute.    "
